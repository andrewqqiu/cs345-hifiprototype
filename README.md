## Freecycling!
Course assignment for CS345 at UoA.
This is a high fidelity prototype for Freecycling!, a service that allows individuals to give items away for free to minimise waste. The prototype is primarily a visual design exercise, and therfore implements only a homepage and registration form; no other links, pages, or backend functions are included.

It is designed only for 1920x1080 screens (full responsiveness was out of scope for the assignment), but a minimal level of responsiveness is built in to the design, and it should be reasonably viewable on all desktop and medium-form-factor devices.
